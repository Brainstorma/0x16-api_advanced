# 0x16. API advanced

Welcome to the **0x16. API advanced** repository! This repository contains all the projects and tasks completed as a part of my journey as an expert software engineer, where I learned how to work with advanced operations and techniques of API. In this repository, you will find a series of tasks that will help you explore the world of APIs, such as data retrieval, parsing, and authentication.

## Tasks

### [0. 0-subs.py](./0-subs.py)
This task requires writing a function that queries the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) and returns the number of subscribers of a given subreddit. 

### [1. Top Ten](./1-top_ten.py)
This task requires writing a function that queries the Reddit API and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts listed for a given subreddit.

### [2. Recurse it!](./2-recurse.py)
This task requires writing a function that queries the Reddit API and returns a list of all hot articles recursively.

### [3. Count it!](./100-count.py)
This task requires writing a function that queries the Reddit API, parses the title of all hot articles and prints a sorted count of given keywords.

## Usage
To use the code in this repository, simply clone the repository and run the desired script in your terminal followed by the necessary arguments. For example, to execute the *0-subs.py* script, run the following command:
```
$ ./0-subs.py programming
```
This will return the number of subscribers for the *programming* subreddit.

## Conclusion

This repository includes all the tasks required to learn advanced operations and techniques for working with APIs. By working through these projects, you will learn how to make API requests, parse JSON data, and automate repetitive tasks. Additionally, you will become familiar with working with some of the most popular APIs, such as Twitter and Wikimedia. Happy Learning!
